## ToDo

* Dates import still doesn't work in all versions of excel.

* Don't require sort by date in homework.

* Quiz with open text entries causes too many errors ("8 crimes")

* Numbers are truncated in some csv files because of import causing them to be converted to scientific notation/text.

* Clean data before changing the types.
